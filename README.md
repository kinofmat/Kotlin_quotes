# Overview

I created a simple quote processor. It can pull quotes from a database (a text document), and either give the user an actual one, or a mixed up one to be more entertaining. Additionally, the user can add some of their favorite quotes to the file as well. 

I created this project as a way to learn how to use Kotlin and become familiar with some basic structures in the language. I hadn't used Kotlin at all before and this helped to broaden the languages that I am able to use.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

I used IntelliJ for this project, which seems to be an excellent IDE to use.

I used Kotlin, and also added from the Java libraries, io.file, and util.Random. These were to allow me to work with the file I used as the database, and generate a random number for selecting the quotes.
Having worked with Java a little in the past, I have found Kotlin to be much easier to use, and I enjoyed working in this language.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* I would like to be able to add another way to mix up the quotes more. Maybe mix up three instead of just two.
* In order to get an even broader understanding of Kotlin, and a larger database, it would be beneficial to find a quote database online and write the program to install that and use it instead.  
* In a more long term goal, I would like to explore more with an AI that could findt ways to better link the spliced quotes that would make more sense in the english language.
